# Personal Website

The following website is a personal project to develop a portfolio representing my programming capabilities. This is also for educational purposes in order to attain a better understanding of key concepts in a fun and interactive manner - including more fundamental skills such as testing and React philosophies.

The website is hosted on github pages through: https://Charteris.github.io/PersonalWebsite/
